2. **Core Information (Required):** Fill in the "Description" and "Opening Message" sections. Be sure to provide detailed information!
    1. The "Description" defines the overall concept of your bot. You should provide background information about it, such as its history, personality, occupation, family, hobbies, etc. (It doesn't have to be human; it can also be another species.) Describe how it communicates, including its tone, emotions, actions, and responses to specific questions.
    2. The "Opening Message" determines how the bot's conversation begins. This is crucial! You need to describe the starting scene for the dialogue.

3. **Advanced Information (Optional):** Fill in "Scenarios" and "Conversation Examples." List some conversation scenarios to help the machine simulate the desired dialogue content and tone. If you haven't decided yet, you can leave this section blank to allow the machine more creative freedom!
