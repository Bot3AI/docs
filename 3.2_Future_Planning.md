## Future Planning

The development plans for BOT3 are as follows:
1. BOT3 self-built LLM (Language and Learning Model).
2. Multi-modal chat (character expressions, GIFs, text-to-speech).
3. Bot tagging system.
4. User reward system (check-in/referral, etc.).

More features coming soon! Stay tuned!
